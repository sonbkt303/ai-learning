- Explore missing values and trends

---

## 📅 Phase 3: Math for AI (Weeks 5–6)

### 🎯 Goal
Understand the essential math behind AI — **matrix operations, probability, and calculus basics.**

### 📘 Topics
- Linear Algebra (Vectors, Matrices, Dot Product, Eigenvalues)
- Probability & Statistics (Distributions, Bayes Theorem)
- Derivatives & Gradients (for learning how models update)
